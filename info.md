:bangbang: **About** :bangbang:

We are a  community that aims to give newcomers a friendly welcome to Warframe as they gain more experience. This involves providing structured guidance and a low pressure environment. We also host channels for a variety of other games that change with demand. Regardless of experience, everyone should be able to find a group.
Enjoy and have fun!

:bangbang: **Finding/Hosting a squad:** :bangbang: 

Follow these steps to join squads ASAP!

1. *(optional)* Head to <#488157674215702528> and join one of the currently available recruiting roles.

2. Head to <#227902513070735360> and @mention one (or more) of the recruiting roles, or just wait for someone else to do the same (you will get a notification when this happens).
For example: `Hosting @Sorties, need 3 more.`
Note that **hosting a squad doesn't mean that you need to lead it or that you need any kind of experience**. Whoever invites people to the in-game lobby is the host.

3. Once there is enough of you to start a group, simply join an open channel (*avoid joining a channel before the host has advertised it in <#227902513070735360>*) or create a temporary channel and set up in there.

4. If you would like to stop getting notifications, head back to <#488157674215702528> and leave the role(s) that you joined. Feel free to keep the role if you want to always be notified. They are used for notification purposes only.

:bangbang: **Temporary channels:** :bangbang: 

Anyone can create temporary channel simply typing in #botspam one of those commands:
`/create chat`
`/create squad`

Once you created the channel, you can rename it and set a user limit by clicking the gear wheel to the right of the name, or right click -> ‘Edit Channel’.

If you want to create a locked channel, just type `--locked` after the command, then proceed to invite other users with `/invite @UserA#1234, @UserB#4321`, etc…

You can also force members to use push-to-talk in the channel by typing `/create chat --ptt` or single users by typing `/invite @UserA#1234 --ptt`.

:bangbang: **Roles:** :bangbang: 

`Moderator / Server Staff`: The Moderators and administrative staff of the server.
`Teacher`: Experienced players that can give instructional knowledge and directions to newer players in the Warframe community.

Some of the roles are there for notification purposes only. For example: `@Sorties`, `@XpFarm`, `@Destiny`

You can join and leave some of those roles at any time by adding reactions in <#488157674215702528>, which will toggle the role.
If the reaction roles do not work, you can type `/rank join <rolename>` and `/rank leave <rolename>` in <#215482906875789312>.
You can type `/rank list` to see all the roles you can join and leave with the backup bot.

:exclamation:  **Do you want to invite someone else to the server?** :exclamation: 

There are two primary ways that you can do that:

1.) Give them the permanent invite link yourself: https://discord.gg/wfrsb
2.) Generate your own (temporary) link by hovering your mouse over <#215314432887095297> and clicking on the little box

:bangbang: **Consider this section now undergoing remodeling** :bangbang: 

Since raids have been removed from the game, this channel is currently receiving heavy maintenance. It will be updated sporadically, and we recommend that you don't mute the channel so that you know when it's updated.
